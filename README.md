# Judge's Universal Digital Grading Evaluator

Hi! Welcome to JUDGE! This tool was developed for the Quality & Safety Summit hosted by the Marshall University School of Medicine. If you are onboarding development, make sure you read the full document and have NodeJS, Composer, and gulp installed.

Before starting development, run `npm install`, `composer install`, and lastly, `gulp build` to download dependencies and build the porject.

While developing, you can either run `gulp watch` for continuous building, or run `gulp build` after you have made any changes.
